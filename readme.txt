This being my committed first hand experience in GitHub, I have been able to do some cool stuffs by visiting GitHub.com alone.
 
I signed up successfully by filling a form that requested for a username,email,and password. 
I was also able to create a new repository which was initialized with a README.
A readme.txt file was also created with this description included.

GitHub is truly an outstanding platform and I look forward to explore it fully. 
Thanks.
